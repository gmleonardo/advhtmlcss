      <h2>Google Analytics Report</h2>
      <h3>2.1 An Introduction</h3>
      <p>Before analyzing the report, we would like to explain what Google Analytics Report is. We will answer that 
        it is a powerful tool offered by Google that lets us to insight into our customers anytime they access our 
        Website. E ach action applied by our User or potential customer is registered as a fountain of data, 
        and with that vital information, we can help define strategies in our business. This tool is a 
        shovel that will help us get information about the users' behavior and how they react to our Website 
        or web apps. If we know their behavior better, we can optimize our content, attract even more customers, 
        and increase our revenue, which is our primary goal.</p><br><p>Although our first experience will be 
        analyzing report Snapshot, Google Analytics offers precise measuring, reporting, and exploring 
        steps created with JavaScript coding (called Global Site tag-gtag.js ) implemented in our HTML files 
        and Google developed it.</p><br><p style=margin-bottom:3rem>But now we are going to see how does it
           work technically? So we start with our image, which shows that Google Analytics Snapshot is a 
           fancy visualization report with multiple features.</p>
           <img alt="Google Analytics Snapshot Report"src=fig0.png style=width:100%><br>
           <h3>2.2 Snapshot Report and its interpretation</h3>
           <p style=margin-top:3rem p>Concerning Report snapshots, we can even interpret what is 
            happening on our Website in real-time. We see information about our users, where they 
            come from, what page they're on right now, what they click, and many other data points. 
            In reality, we have a summary of what is happening on our Website with the Users. We 
            will divide the picture into six parts to better understand it.<p><strong>2.2.a Our section on the top-left</strong>
           is essential information about the User. First, we can define the User as a person who accesses our Website using a 
           PC, laptop, o any device. Then, in this section, we have some metrics about Users.</p>
           <img alt="Google Analytics Snapshot Report Section Users"src=fig1.png style=width:70%>
           <div class=users>
            <li>The first value, <strong>99K Users</strong>, is the total number of people who checked our 
            Website over a period called the range date of the report. In our case, that period 
            is between May 08th to Jun 10th.<li>The second value is <strong>86K New Users</strong> 
              who saw our Website for the first time. So, we can interpret that 86% of our Users 
              accessed the Website for the first time, and 14% have accessed it more than once.
            <li>A critical definition is the <strong>Average Engagement Time</strong>; the average time the users 
              navigate or interact with the content on our Website. For our example, currently is 1 minute and 37 
              seconds. It is critical because we need to understand what we can do in that period if we can reach 
              an economic conversion.<li>With a universe of 99K Users and almost one month of range date, it 
                generated $234K. First, however, we must compare it with other range dates to recognize it as a bad or 
                good period.<li>Finally, we observe a trend line (a graphic) of the last 30 days that daily shows a 
                  minimum and maximum Users who accesed our website (approximately 3K and 5K Users, respectively, in 
                  our case with a sinusoidal pattern. We observe high and low levels, but it keeps a range of users.
            <li>An interesting question is why the number of Users is more significant than the number of New Users 
              because the first variable is the total summation of the old and new users. We can calculate the 
            ercentage of new and old users with both values as we did.
          </div>
            <p style=margin-top:3rem><strong>2.2.b Our section in the top center</strong> 
              is the best reference for an exciting real-time concept. It is designed for three sections, 
              n absolute value of the number of users, a histogram, and a demographic histogram with the 
              top countries who visited our Website in the last 30 minutes.</p>
              <img alt="Google Analytics Snapshot Report Section 30 last minutes"src=fig2.png style=width:60%>
              
          <div class=users>
            <li>The first number. <strong>82</strong>. is how many users have accessed our website in the last 30 minutes.
            <li>Then, with more details, we can see a histogram that has 30 columns with a smooth distribution. 
              Each column shows how many Users visited our website in one minute.
            <li>Finally, the top four countries with the highest accessing our website with their 
            respective number of Users. First position, USA, Mexico, Indonesia, Canada, and China.
          </div>
          <p style=margin-top:3rem><strong>2.2.c Our section on the top-right is called Insight.</strong> 
            The most important part is related to the metric of the Website conversion. Website conversion 
            is an event that is valuable for our business and helps us to reach the revenue. Website conversion 
            happens when someone completes a predetermined and desired action on our Website, from signing up 
            for a newsletter, sharing information on social media, or buying a product.</p>
          <img alt="Google Analytics Snapshot Report with Conversion information"src=fig3.png style=width:50%>
          <div class=users><li>Our first indicator explains that we got a 35.33% conversion conversions with Google Engine.
            <li>The second indicator shows that we reached a better projections with respect the original prediction has 
              been planified previously with Google Merchandise Store.This case was a 293.48%.
          </div>
          <p style=margin-top:3rem><strong>2.2.d Our section on the lower-left</strong> 
            started with a question provided by Google <strong>"Where do our New Users come from? "</strong>
             which should help us get the insights.There are kind of navigating in our analysis.
            </p><img alt="Google Analytics Snapshot Report with Conversion information"src=fig3b.png style=width:90%>
