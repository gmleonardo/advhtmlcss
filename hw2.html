        <h2>Google Analytics Report</h2>
        <h3>2.1 An Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Before analyzing the report, we would like to explain what Google
          Analytics Report is. We will answer that it is a powerful tool offered
          by Google that lets us to insight into our customers anytime they
          access our website. Each action applied by our User or potential
          customer is registered as a fountain of data, and with that vital
          information, we can help define strategies in our business. This tool
          is a shovel that will help us get information about the users'
          behavior and how they react to our website or web apps. If we know
          their behavior better, we can optimize our content, attract even more
          customers, and increase our revenue, which is our primary goal.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          Although our first experience will be analyzing report Snapshot,
          Google Analytics offers precise measuring, reporting, and exploring
          steps created with JavaScript coding (called Global Site tag-gtag.js )
          implemented in our HTML files and Google developed it.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p style="margin-bottom: 3rem">
          But now we are going to see how does it work technically? So we start
          with our image, which shows that Google Analytics Snapshot is a fancy
          visualization report with multiple features.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>2.2 Snapshot Report and its interpretation</h3>
        <p p style="margin-top: 3rem">
          Concerning Report snapshots, we can even interpret what is happening
          on our website in real-time. We see information about our users, where
          they come from, what page they're on right now, what they click, and
          many other data points. In reality, we have a summary of what is
          happening on our website with the Users. We will divide the picture
          into six parts to better understand it.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2.2.a Our section on the top-left</strong> is essential
          information about the User. We can define the User as a person who
          accesses our website using a PC, laptop, o any device. Then, in this
          section, we have some metrics about Users.
        </p>

        <img
          src="fig1.png"
          alt="Google Analytics Snapshot Report Section Users"
          style="width: 70%"
        />

        <div class="users">
          <li>
            The first value, <strong>99K Users</strong>, is the total number of
            people who checked our website over a period called the range date
            of the report. In our case, that period is between May 08th to Jun
            10th.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second value is <strong>86K New Users</strong> who saw our
            website for the first time. So, we can interpret that 86% of our
            Users accessed the website for the first time, and 14% have accessed
            it more than once.
          </li>
          <li>
            A critical definition is the
            <strong>Average Engagement Time</strong>; the average time for which
            the users navigate or interacting with the content on our website.
            For our example, currently is 1 minute and 37 seconds.It is one of
            the most critical, because we need to understand what we can do in
            that period if we can reach a economic conversion.
          </li>
          <li>
            With a universe of 99K Users and almost one month of range date, it
            generated $234K. First, however, we must compare it with other range
            dates to recognize it as a bad or good period.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, we observe a trend line (a graphic) of the last 30 days
            that daily shows a minimum and maximum Users (approximately 3K and
            5K Users, respectively, in our case with a sinusoidal pattern. We
            observe high and low levels, but it keeps a range of users.
          </li>
          <li>
            An interesting question is why the number of Users is more
            significant than the number of New Users because the first variable
            is the total summation of the old and new users. We can calculate
            the percentage of new and old users with both values as we did.
          </li>
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: 3rem">
          <strong>2.2.b Our section on the top-center</strong> is the best
          reference about an interesting concept called real time. It is
          designed for 3 sections, a absolute value of number of users, an
          histogram and a demographic histogram with tops countries who visit
          our website in the last 30 minutes.

            accessed our website in the last 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, with more details, we can see a histogram that has 30 columns
            with a smooth distribution. Each column shows how many Users visited
            our website in one minute.
          </li>

          <li>
            Finally, the top four countries with the highest accessing our
            website with their respective number of Users. First position, USA,
            Mexico, Indonesia, Canada, and China.

          <strong>2.2.c Our section on the top-right is called Insight.</strong>
          The most important part is related to the metric of the Website
          conversion. Website conversion is an event that is valuable for our
          business and helps us to reach the revenue. Website conversion happens
          when someone completes a predetermined and desired action on our
          Website, from signing up for a newsletter, sharing information on
          social media, or buying a product.
