        <h2>3. Performance and Organization of HTML and CSS Files</h2>
        <h3>3.1 An important case: Compression of Image</h3>
        <p>One essential procedure for maintaining good performance with our website is to analyze the size of the pictures 
          that we have included. If they are heavy our website will be slow. For this reason, it is required to apply compress 
          to the image, which has essential benefits:</p><br>
          <ul class="backgroundg users">
            <li>Keeping a good performance when we demand access to the browser with a light picture on HTML.
            <li>Preserving its original size (width x height) and reduce its size without losing the quality of the images.

          </ul>
          <p>For example, we can analyze the following images. A picture form NewBurryport, Massachusetts. Its original 
            size is 7.49 MB and it was reduced to 392 KB (95% of reduction ) and we can observer that it keeps a good quality.
          <figure class=imageCompress><img alt="A lake close to NewBurryport, Massachusetts"src=newburryport.jpg>
            <figcaption><strong>Original Picture:</strong> Width:4032px, Height:3024px, Size:7.697.913 bytes (7.34 MB)
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure class=imageCompress>
          <img alt="A lake close to NewBurryport, Massachusetts, which was compressed "src=newburryport-min.jpg>
          <figcaption><strong>Compressed Picture:</strong>Width:4032px, Height:3024px, Size: 401.907 bytes (392 KB)
          </figcaption></figure>
          <h3>3.2 How we can compress a picture?</h3>
          <p style=margin-top:3rem>There are many options on the web to complete this procedure. However, 
          we can check this link <strong><a href=https://imagecompressor.com/ target=_blank>Optimizilla</a></strong> . 
          I liked this option because they have online image optimizer that use compression algorithms to shrink JPEG, 
          GIF, and PNG files, where we can reach a minimum possible size, while we do not lose the required level of 
          quality of image, and its processing is quick and to download the compressed image is straightforward.
          <p style=font-size:15px><strong>Steps:</strong>
          <ul class="backgroundg users without">
            <li>3.2.1. Uploading the file.Check the next images.
            <li><figure class=imageCompress><img alt="On the Optimizilla website Uploading a image file "src=fig3-1.png>
            </figure>
            <li>3.2.2. Adjusting the image file with Quality Value. It is required to click on Appy button, located at 
            the bottom.
            <li>
              <figure class=imageCompress>
                <img alt="Adjusting the size of file on the Optimizilla website  "src=fig3-2.png>
              </figure>
            <li>3.2.3. Choosing a percentage of compression, in this example was 95%.Next step we can click on 
              Download All icon.
            <li>
              <figure class=imageCompress>
              <img alt="Compression of image with a 95%  on the Optimizilla website  "src=fig3-3.png>
            </figure>
          </ul>
          <h3>3.3 Checking Download Time with Chrome Developer Tools (CDT)</h3>
          <p>When we refresh this HTML and analyze each picture, we see that the original downloaded 
            image is slower than the compressed image. So if we would like to check the real-time, we can 
            quantify their download time if using the CDT with the following steps:
            <ul class="backgroundg users without">
              <li>3.3.1. On the Browser, with Mouse Bottom #3 (MB3),Inspection. Then click on NetWork Tab
              <li>
                <figure class=imageCompress><img alt="On the Optimizilla website Uploading a image file "src=fig3-4.png>
                </figure>
              <li>3.3.2. We can see that there is a tabular list with each component of the website.In my case, we 
                pay attention with newburryport.png and newburryport-mini.png and the column called Time. 
                For each files we have two download time. For the original image file is 44ms, while the 
                compressed image file is 14ms.
              <li>
                <figure class=imageCompress><img alt="Adjusting the size of file on the Optimizilla website  "src=fig3-5.png>
               </figure>
               <li>3.3.3 In the previous image, if we click on Waterfall column, we can see more details about the 
                download time.
